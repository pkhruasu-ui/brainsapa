Name : Angular-setup
Version : 2.0.0 (Kunlai)
Description : 	Template folder structure using RequireJS and AngularJS.
		The purpose of this framework is to scaffold a quick project with production process built-in. 
		Suit for small or medium size project.

Goal :		- RequireJS and AngularJS built-in.
		- Unit test with Karma and E2E test with Protractor.
		- Deverloper's help tools such as grunt watch, JSLint, LiveReload.
		- CSS compiler(Sass).

Concept :	1. Must be lightweight. This should just be a scaffolder framework with minimum 
		   effort to use. 
		2. No global install. Once doing npm install everything should be 
		   installed locally.
